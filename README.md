# taskManagerApp

A simple task manager app made with Vue.js for a school assessment.

# How To Use

First open a terminal window in the task-manager-app folder and run the following command: npm run serve

This should make it so the app runs on http://localhost:8080

Next, open another terminal in the task-manager-api folder and run the following command: node server.js

Now you can go to http://localhost:3000/tasks to see how the data gets stored.

Now you can go back to the app and use it to input tasks, mark them as completed and remove them
